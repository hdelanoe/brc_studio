"BRC built this mixtape as a sport game, with an ambient intro and a gradual rise of BPM transposed by dislocated beats of UK Bass and acid house. The game reaches its peaktime at 160BPM with ghetto house banger Dont’ Stop. With dry and rounded variations, the mixtape’s kick explores all of our muscles. To defeat our opponent, we need to slalom between ghetto tech, trap free style and breaked house. The last dance goes to a poppy stroll that relieves in a warm hug sweaty bodies."
